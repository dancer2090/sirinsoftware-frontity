It’s best to simply be up-to-date with all the major issues, which we shall discuss. But let’s start with the definition.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three Pillars of DevSecOps</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is DevOps security</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a nutshell? Here’s the </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/devsecops\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">definition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security by Gartner</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3752\" src=\"https://admin.sirinsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-05-15-00-01.png\" alt=\"DevOps Security Practice\" width=\"876\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://admin.sirinsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-05-15-00-01.png 876w, https://admin.sirinsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-05-15-00-01-350x95.png 350w, https://admin.sirinsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-05-15-00-01-768x208.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security engineer roles and responsibilities,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the global sense, everything<strong> is focused on achieving the following software goals</strong>:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Consistency <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– security measures in DevSecOps aren’t implemented at any particular stage and aren’t used as a stand-alone tool; safety aspects here comprise a set of specific standards throughout the stages of technical specification composition, design implementation, development, testing, and finished product deployment.</span></b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provisioning</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– delivery of security solutions for software should be as automated as possible so as not to cause downtime and expose vulnerabilities.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Speed and agility</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– security solutions in the context of DevSecOps should be as flexible as possible and quickly adapt to changing operating conditions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Regular &amp; Cloud DevOps Security Issues</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fact that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps can increase system security</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is it worth sacrificing already agreed upon and established workflows that have been built up for years? Indeed, when upgrading familiar security mechanisms, you may encounter a number of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security challenges</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Time penalty</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the initial stages of introducing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps system security</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your team members will have to get used to innovations that can affect not only security aspects but the whole system. Surely, this will take some time, and at first, interaction with updated software may not proceed as fast as one would like.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>DevOps cloud security issues</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the major </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security risks</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are also possible issues with the cloud provider. Thus, despite the fact that <strong>DevSecOps can provide a different level of protection for your system due to its end-to-end approach to security</strong>, this methodology doesn’t cover possible vulnerabilities on the cloud provider’s side. That is why it is recommended to use trusted suppliers with a developed infrastructure. For instance, we often practice </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security in AWS</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Outdated software and/or hardware</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the DevSecOps practice is quite novel, not every <a href=\"https://sirinsoftware.com/services/hardware_development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardware</a> and software solution is capable of supporting </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security tools</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, in general, of meeting the requirements that it puts forward. Therefore, you will probably need to update some elements of the existing system to ensure compatibility with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security platforms</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can be quite costly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>High rates for DevSecOps specialists</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Senior-Devops-Engineer-Salary\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the average salary of a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DevOps security engineer</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the USA is around $134,000, which is a very substantial sum for small companies. On the other hand, you can look for outsourced specialists who work for significantly lower rates while delivering the same level of quality.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only truly effective way to overcome all the challenges above is to have a team of experienced DevSecOps specialists at your side. We may have just what you’re looking for.
